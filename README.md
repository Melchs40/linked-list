# linked-list

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the concept and excution of linked lists. By becoming familiar with them, I should be able to better know when to apply this concept and when to use a traditional array structure for data. This will allow me to get a better grasp on dynamic data structures before learning more complex ones like binary trees and graphs.
